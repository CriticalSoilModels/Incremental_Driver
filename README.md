# Incremental_Driver

This incremental driver software was taken directly from: [Niemunis SoilModels](https://soilmodels.com/idriver/)

Some slight modifications have been made so that it can compile using as a .f90 file and to
move some of the functions to another file to make it easier to see the main program.

Additionally, this repo compiles incremental driver using the [fortran package manager](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm)

The goal of this repo is to host the incremental driver on github so changes can be made and tracked more easily.

A big thank you to Andrzej Niemunis for all the work done to write this code.
